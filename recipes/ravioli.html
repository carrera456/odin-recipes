    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade ravioli recipe includes a pesto-Alfredo sauce and marinara. I wanted to recreate the ravioli dish that you get at Maggiano's Italian restaurant and it turned out great! Don't be intimidated by the large list of ingredients, it is well worth it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For the dough:</strong>All-purpose flour, salt, eggs, water, and olive oil</li>
      <li><strong>For the filling:</strong>Ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, an egg, and dried parsley</li>
      <li><strong>For the sauce:</strong>Olive oil, garlic, prepared basil pesto sauce (you can use store-bought or homemade sauce), heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong>Make and knead the dough, then form it into a ball. Tightly wrap the ball and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. </li>
      <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong>Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside.</li>
      <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong>Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, then whisk in the Parmesan.</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble the ravioli:</strong>Roll out the dough into sheets. Drop cheese filling onto the dough about an inch apart. Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a seal around each portion of filling. Cut out individual ravioli, then seal the edges.</li>
    </ol>
